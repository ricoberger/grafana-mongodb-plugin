## Adding new Features

## Development

You'll need to have the following tools set up:

- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [Mage](https://magefile.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   npm run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   npm run test:ci
   ```

5. Run the tests (using Mage)

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   go tool mage -v test

   # Run tests and create coverage report ("open coverage/backend.htm")
   go tool mage -v coverage
   ```

6. Build the plugin backend code, rerun this command every time you edit your
   backend files

   ```bash
   go tool mage -v build:linuxARM64
   ```

7. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   export MONGODB_PASSWORD=

   npm run server
   ```

8. Run the linter

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # or

   npm run lint:fix
   ```

# Release

The [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) handles the creation of
new releases. To trigger the workflow we need to push a version tag to GitHub.
This can be achieved with the following steps:

1. Run `npm version <major|minor|patch>`
2. Run `git push origin main --follow-tags`
